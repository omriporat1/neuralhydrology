# Decision Log

## 2026-05-06

- Confirmed GFS `.idx` byte-range extraction end-to-end; the acquisition path is validated and frozen except for plotting.
- Confirmed IFS 00/12 UTC MARS retrievals succeed, while 06/18 UTC remain unresolved and should stay open as an access/request issue.
- Confirmed IMERG NC4 download is valid; crop logic still needs repair and final nonzero selected-CONUS confirmation.
- Retained RTMA despite size/time cost because it is scientifically important for the Stage 1 pipeline.

## 2026-05-06 IFS Stream Investigation

- Tested `oper/fc` requests for 06 UTC and 18 UTC on 2023-01-01 with `area` subset and without `area`; all returned `MARS_EXPECTED_FIELDS` with 0 retrieved fields.
- Tested `oper/fc` with the current variable set at `step=0` and `step=0/to/24/by/1`; both area-subset and full-domain forms failed for 06 UTC and 18 UTC.
- Tested `scda` alternatives with a minimal `2T` request at `step=0`.
- `scda/type=fc` succeeded for both 06 UTC and 18 UTC.
- `scda/type=an` succeeded for both 06 UTC and 18 UTC.
- `scda/type=cf` failed with `MARS_EXPECTED_FIELDS` and 0 retrieved fields.
- The area subset `50/-126/24/-66` did not explain the oper failures.
- **Stream fix implemented**: 00/12 UTC use `oper/fc`, while 06/18 UTC use `scda/fc`.
- Provisional recommendation: use the deterministic `scda` path for historical 06/18 UTC retrievals; keep `oper` as the working path for 00/12 UTC and do not assume only 2 historical IFS cycles exist.

## 2026-05-06 IFS Resolution Comparison

- Tested 2023-01-01 historical retrievals at two grid resolutions:
  - **0.25/0.25**: current configuration
  - **0.1/0.1**: proposed higher resolution
- For cycles 00 UTC (oper/fc) and 06 UTC (scda/fc), tested both minimal requests (1 variable, 1 step) and full requests (7 variables, 25 steps).
- **Results**: Both resolutions retrieved successfully with 100% pass rate.
  - 0.25/0.25: ~17.9 MB total for both cycles (8.9 MB per cycle average)
  - 0.1/0.1: ~110.5 MB total for both cycles (55.3 MB per cycle average)
  - Ratio: 0.1/0.1 is ~6.2× larger
- **Timing**: Higher resolution added ~5–15 seconds per request but remained well within operational tolerance.
- **Recommendation**: Adopt **0.1/0.1 resolution** to align with IFS's scientific value (higher resolution than GFS).
  - Justification: Estimated annual burden ~80 GB (acceptable for 2-year window); retrieval time penalty negligible; area subset remains supported.
  - Contingency: Revert to 0.25/0.25 requires single config change if burden becomes untenable.
- **Decision**: Update `IfsMarsConfig.grid` to `0.1/0.1` and document stream logic in code comments.

## 2026-05-07 IFS 0.1-Degree Estimate Verification

- Verified estimate inputs without changing IFS retrieval logic:
  - 00/12 UTC: `oper/fc`
  - 06/18 UTC: `scda/fc`
  - `grid=0.1/0.1`, `area=50/-126/24/-66`, 7 variables, `step=0..24`, 4 cycles/day.
- Recomputed period: 2020-10-14T00:00:00 to 2025-12-31T23:59:59 (inclusive, 1,905 days; 7,620 cycles).
- Empirical sample bytes per cycle (full request, from resolution test): **54,920,250 bytes**.
- Bytes per day (4 cycles): **219,681,000 bytes** (~219.681 MB/day, ~209.505 MiB/day).
- Full-period raw download estimate: **418,492,305,000 bytes** (~418.492 GB, ~389.751 GiB).
- Full-period retained raw estimate: **418,492,305,000 bytes** (same as download estimate under current workflow assumptions).
- Derived basin-average estimate (9,000 basins; hourly; 7 vars; float32 parquet): **11,521,440,000 bytes** (~11.521 GB, ~10.730 GiB).
- Estimated acquisition time (using measured full-request mean cycle time: (54.40s + 42.36s)/2 = 48.38s):
  - ~193.52s/day (~3.23 min/day)
  - ~368,655.6s total (~102.40 h, ~4.27 days) if executed sequentially.
- Validation of prior wording: **"~80 GB/year" is approximately correct in decimal units**.
  - Recomputed value: **80.184 GB/year** (or **74.677 GiB/year** binary).

## 2026-05-07 IMERG Crop And Preview Plot Repair

- Repaired IMERG CONUS crop handling for dynamic coordinate layouts and dimension order, including `time,lat,lon`, `time,lon,lat`, `lat,lon`, and `lon,lat` forms.
- Added robust crop logging for IMERG:
  - original dims and coordinate names
  - original lon/lat bounds
  - cropped lon/lat bounds
  - cropped shape and min/max/mean/nan_pct
- Added hard failure when IMERG crop result is empty and when `selected_conus_bytes` is zero.
- Verified targeted IMERG validation on 2023-01-01 (`3B-DAY-L.MS.MRG.3IMERG.20230101-S000000-E235959.V07B.nc4`):
  - `selected_conus_bytes=624000` (nonzero)
  - crop bounds `lon=[-125.950, -66.050]`, `lat=[24.050, 49.950]`
  - crop shape `(260, 600)`
- Repaired preview plotting axes/orientation to use true lon/lat extent and north-up orientation logic.
- Added preview bounds validation logging (`preview_bounds_validation=PASS/FAIL`) and summary payloads.
- Verified preview bounds validation passed for:
  - IMERG: PASS
  - GFS: PASS
  - IFS: PASS
- Generated run artifacts under `reports/audit_2026_04_29/run_07_imerg_plot_repair/` with lightweight review bundle (no raw NC4/GRIB files).
